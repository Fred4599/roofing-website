Severe weather in the Treasure Valley can strike without warning. Whether it's a summer hailstorm, strong winds, or a winter ice event, knowing what to do immediately after storm damage can make the difference between a smooth insurance claim and a frustrating experience.

## Immediate Steps After a Storm

### 1. Ensure Safety First

Before anything else, make sure everyone in your household is safe. If you see major structural damage, downed power lines, or other hazards, stay away and contact emergency services if needed.

**Do not go on your roof to inspect damage.** This is dangerous, especially when the surface may be wet, damaged, or structurally compromised.

### 2. Document Everything

Once it's safe, start documenting damage from the ground:

- **Take photos and video** of all visible damage from multiple angles
- **Document the date and time** of the storm
- **Note the weather conditions** (hail size, wind direction, etc.)
- **Keep damaged materials** if any have fallen (shingles, siding pieces)
- **Photograph your whole property** including areas that look undamaged

This documentation is crucial for your insurance claim. The more thorough, the better.

### 3. Prevent Further Damage

You have a responsibility to prevent additional damage to your home. This might include:

- Covering broken windows with plastic or plywood
- Placing buckets under active leaks
- Calling for emergency tarping if there's a large hole in your roof

Keep receipts for any materials you purchase—your insurance typically reimburses these costs.

### 4. Contact Your Insurance Company

Call your insurance company to report the damage as soon as possible. Most policies require prompt notification. Have your policy number ready and provide:

- Date and time of the storm
- Type of damage observed
- Photos if you can email or upload them
- Any emergency repairs you've made

Ask about your claim process timeline and what to expect next.

## Working With Roofing Contractors

### Getting Professional Inspections

While you can see obvious damage from the ground, professional roofers identify damage that homeowners miss. Hail damage to shingles, for example, often isn't visible from below but significantly affects roof performance.

We recommend getting a professional inspection before your insurance adjuster visit. A detailed damage report from an experienced contractor helps ensure nothing is overlooked.

### Be Wary of Storm Chasers

After significant storms, out-of-state contractors flood the area. While some are legitimate, many are not. Warning signs include:

- **Door-to-door solicitation** immediately after storms
- **High-pressure sales tactics** and demands for quick signatures
- **Offers to waive your deductible** (this is insurance fraud)
- **No local address** or verifiable references
- **Requests for large upfront payments**
- **Cannot provide proof of Idaho contractor license**

We recommend working with established local contractors who will be here long after the storm chasers leave.

## The Insurance Claim Process

### What to Expect

1. **Claim filed** - You report the damage to your insurance company
2. **Adjuster assigned** - An insurance adjuster will be assigned to your claim
3. **Inspection scheduled** - The adjuster will inspect your property
4. **Estimate provided** - You'll receive an estimate of covered damages
5. **Work completed** - Once approved, repairs or replacement can proceed
6. **Final payment** - After work completion, any remaining payment is released

### Having Your Contractor Present

We highly recommend having your roofing contractor present during the adjuster's inspection. Experienced contractors:

- Identify damage adjusters might miss
- Speak the same technical language
- Advocate for complete repairs
- Ensure scope of work is adequate

This isn't adversarial—it simply ensures a thorough, accurate assessment.

### If Your Claim Is Underpaid

Sometimes initial claim amounts don't cover necessary repairs. Options include:

- **Request re-inspection** with additional documentation
- **File a supplemental claim** for missed damage
- **Provide contractor estimates** showing actual repair costs
- **Escalate within the insurance company** if needed

A knowledgeable roofing contractor can help navigate these situations.

## Common Types of Storm Damage in Idaho

### Hail Damage

Hail is common during Treasure Valley summers. Damage includes:

- Bruised or cracked shingles
- Dented metal vents, flashing, and gutters  
- Damaged siding
- Broken skylights

Hail damage often looks minor but compromises your roof's water-shedding ability.

### Wind Damage

Strong winds can:

- Lift and tear shingles
- Blow off ridge caps
- Damage soffits and fascia
- Deposit debris causing secondary damage

### Ice and Snow Damage

Winter weather causes:

- Ice dams leading to water intrusion
- Heavy snow loads stressing structure
- Freeze-thaw damage to materials

## Timeline Considerations

- **Insurance claim deadlines** vary by policy—typically 1 year, but check yours
- **Material availability** can delay repairs, especially after widespread storms
- **Contractor scheduling** gets busy after major weather events
- **Weather windows** matter—some repairs are weather-dependent

Starting the process quickly gives you the best chance of timely resolution.
